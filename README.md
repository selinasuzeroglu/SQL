# **InProcess Database in SQL**

Given our InProcess Data results, we need to transpone and seperate our csv of interest (wavelengths, values) for each measurement category (transmission, reflection, absorptance, etc.).

The transponed tables will be adjustable in regards to Result Measurement Name and other quantities.

Evetually, these tables will be uploaded to Python as Dataframes and further used to analyze the data.
